Chapter 1: Flowchart & Pseudocode

**Data Structure:
*** Systematic ways to organize, manage and store data for efficient access and modification.
**Algorithm:**
* Step-by-step computational procedures used to perform operations on data, solve problems and achieve desired outcomes efficiently.
* Together DSA enables the development of optimized and scalable software solutions, by determining the most effective way to structure data and the most efficient approach to processing it.
