**Chapter 1: Flowchart & Pseudocode**

**Data Structure:**
* Systematic ways to organize, manage and store data for efficient access and modification.
  
**Algorithm:**
* Step-by-step computational procedures used to perform operations on data, solve problems and achieve desired outcomes efficiently.
* Together DSA enables the development of optimized and scalable software solutions, by determining the most effective way to structure data and the most efficient approach to processing it.

**Flowchart & Pseudocode:**

* A Flowchart is a visual representation of the logic or sequence of steps in a program or algorithm.
* Pseudocode is a high level, human-readable desciption of an algorithm or program, logic that uses plain english mixed with programming style structure.
* It is not written in a specific programming language, and it cannot be executed by a compiler.

**What is ASCII ?**

* ASCII = American Standards of Code Information Interchange
  
**Pseudocode:**
* General Logic of a Solution.
* Step 1: input a & b
* Step 2: sum = a + b
* Step 3: print sum
